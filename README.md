The Cantor website is a web application that has been developed using several technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#. It has also been built using the ASP.NET framework, which is a popular web development platform created by Microsoft.

The website likely consists of several different web pages, each with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that dictate how the page is displayed and how it responds to user interactions. For example, there may be a home page that welcomes visitors to the site, an about page that provides information about the Cantor department at Sheffield Hallam University, and various other pages that allow visitors to access different resources or services.

In addition to the front-end code, the website likely includes server-side code written in C#. This code runs on the server and is responsible for handling user requests, accessing data from a connected database, and generating the appropriate response to send back to the user's browser.

Speaking of the database, it's likely that the Cantor website is connected to a database that stores various types of data related to the department. This could include information about courses. When a user interacts with the website (e.g. by searching for a specific course or faculty member), the server-side code will query the database to retrieve the relevant information and display it to the user.

Overall, the Cantor website is a complex application that combines several different technologies and programming languages to provide visitors with a rich and interactive experience.
